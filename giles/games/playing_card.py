    cards.

    Ranks and Suits are built-in, and jokers are supported but not issued by
    default.  While Suits are a dictionary mapping each suit to an integer
    value, they are not checked when comparing cards to each other.  Aces are
    valued at one or 14; Kings at thirteen.  As such, a Queen of Clubs (with a
    .value() of 12) is greater than a ten of Hearts, and the value() of two
    Queens will be equal, but the Queen of Hearts != the Queen of Spades.  This
    is not a bug; it allows for simple constructions such as "if mycard in
    myhand" without having to go through absurd gymnastics.

    Methods of note are:  __repr_(), value(), and all ordinal comparisons, e.g.
    __lt__().
