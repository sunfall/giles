## *GILES*: the Great Internet Ludic Experience Server ##

Giles is a telnet gaming experience, meant to provide a platform for
playing various games both old and new with nothing more complicated
than a decent telnet client.

Chances are pretty good that:

    telnet ripley.thenexusproject.org 9435

will connect you to the current testing instance of Giles (unless
it's down).  You should also feel free to crank it up on your own.

The official Giles IRC channel is **#giles** on **irc.freenode.net**.
