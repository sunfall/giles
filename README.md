## *GILES*: the Great Internet Ludic Experience Server ##

Giles is a telnet gaming experience, meant to provide a platform for
playing various games both old and new with nothing more complicated
than a decent telnet client.

~~Chances are pretty good that:~~

    telnet ripley.thenexusproject.org 9435

~~will connect you to the current testing instance of Giles (unless~~
~~it's down).  Otherwise feel free to crank it up on your own.~~

Thanks to Isaac, the server is down for the time being.  It should be back up in short order!
